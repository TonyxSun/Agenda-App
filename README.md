# Agenda app

Created for the Surfboard (Daommo) coding challenge. 

Backend: https://github.com/TonyxSun/Agenda-App-Backend

## Configurations and Scripts

The main scripts concerned are `npm run start` and `npm run deploy`. 

### `npm run start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### `npm run deploy`
Builds the app for production to the build folder and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch. The Github Pages site will refresh to incorporate the new build.
